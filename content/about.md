## Our Mission

Open Syndrome is a collaborative initiative to standardize and modernize disease surveillance through machine-readable case definitions.
We believe that by creating an open, standardized format for case definitions, we can improve global health surveillance and response capabilities.

Our work is:

* **Open Source**: All definitions and tools are freely available
* **Collaborative**: Developed with input from clinicians, epidemiologists, and developers
* **Transparent**: All changes and updates are publicly documented
* **Evolving**: Continuously improved based on community feedback

By choosing an open format and Git-based workflow, we're making medical knowledge more accessible and standardized.
This approach enables everything from machine learning research to clinical education.
Practitioners can share their knowledge easily, researchers can develop new syndrome discovery models, and organizations
can implement standardized definitions in their systems.

We work closely with Public Health Organizations, Healthcare Institutions, Software Developers, Academic Researchers, and Surveillance Networks.
