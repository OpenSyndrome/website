# The Open Syndrome Initiative

## Our Mission

Open Syndrome is a collaborative initiative to standardize and modernize disease surveillance through machine-readable case definitions.
We believe that by creating an open, standardized format for case definitions, we can improve global health surveillance and response capabilities.

Our work is:

* **Open Source**: All definitions and tools are freely available
* **Collaborative**: Developed with input from clinicians, epidemiologists, and developers
* **Transparent**: All changes and updates are publicly documented
* **Evolving**: Continuously improved based on community feedback

We work closely with Public Health Organizations, Healthcare Institutions, Software Developers, Academic Researchers, and Surveillance Networks.
