# The Open Syndrome Initiative

## Our Mission

Open Syndrome is a collaborative initiative to standardize and modernize disease surveillance through machine-readable case definitions.
We believe that by creating an open, standardized format for case definitions, we can improve global health surveillance and response capabilities.

Our work is:

* **Open Source**: All definitions and tools are freely available
* **Collaborative**: Developed with input from clinicians, epidemiologists, and developers
* **Transparent**: All changes and updates are publicly documented
* **Evolving**: Continuously improved based on community feedback

We work closely with:

* Public Health Organizations
* Healthcare Institutions
* Software Developers
* Academic Researchers
* Surveillance Networks

## What We Do

* **Standardize**: We convert established case definitions from major health organizations into a structured, machine-readable format
* **Modernize**: We enable automated surveillance systems with clear, programmatic criteria
* **Connect**: We bridge the gap between clinical expertise and technical implementation
* **Share**: We make all definitions freely available to the global health community

## Our Format

The Open Syndrome format (v1.0) provides:

* JSON-based structure for case definitions
* Logical operators for combining clinical criteria
* Support for multiple languages
* Version control for definition updates
* Validation tools for implementation

## Get Involved
