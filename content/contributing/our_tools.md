The Open Syndrome Definition Initiative provides a set of simple tools to make syndrome definitions
accessible in different formats. Whether you're a healthcare practitioner drafting definitions in
plain text or a developer integrating them into your systems, we've got you covered.

## CLI

The `osi` CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to convert case and syndrome definitions in
narrative format to JSON and back. It also provides a simple validation tool to check the syntax.

```bash
osi convert # from human to machine-readable form (JSON)
osi humanize # from machine to human-readable form (text)
osi validate # pass your JSON file and see what is missing
```
