# Open Syndrome Case Definition: Diarrhea

*Released on October 25, 2024*

Today, we are releasing a standardized case definition for Diarrhea in the Open Syndrome format. This definition, based on the [Brighton Collaboration guidelines](https://brightoncollaboration.org/diarrhea/), aims to provide a consistent framework for surveillance and reporting of diarrhea cases, particularly as an Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI).

## Why This Matters

Diarrhea remains a significant global health concern, causing over 2 million deaths annually worldwide. The lack of standardized reporting definitions has historically made it challenging to:

* Compare data across different surveillance systems
* Aggregate information from multiple sources
* Ensure consistent reporting in clinical trials
* Monitor vaccine safety effectively

## The Definition

Our new case definition implements the following criteria in a machine-readable format:

### Primary Diagnostic Criteria
All of the following must be present:
* Loose stools
* â‰¥3 occurrences
* Within a 24-hour period

### Stool Characteristics
At least one of:
* Watery consistency
* Unformed stools

### Associated Signs
Any of the following may be present:
* Clinical dehydration
* Decreased skin turgor
* Sunken eyes
* Low blood pressure (<90/60)

## Technical Implementation

The definition is available in JSON format following the Open Syndrome v1.0 specification. Here's a simplified example:

## Using the Definition

Healthcare organizations can implement this definition through:

* Direct integration with surveillance systems
* API endpoints for real-time validation
* Manual case verification processes

## Next Steps

We encourage:

* Clinical feedback on the definition criteria
* Technical feedback on the implementation format
* Suggestions for additional symptoms or signs
* Reports of implementation experiences
