## Schema

Looking for the schema documentation? Go to [this page]({{< ref "schema_doc" >}}).

## Contribution workflow

Our workflow is deliberately simple: a GitHub repository serves as the central hub where all definitions are stored and managed. Any person can submit a new definition through the [submission contact form]()
or directly via a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
People have also the option of verifying their affiliations and become verified contributors. For this, they need to provide a valid email address and an organization name through the [verification form]().
The definitions from verified contributors receive the tag `verified`. All contributions are reviewed by the community and published on our website after approval and technical validation.

When a definition is submitted though the form, we automatically create a GitHub Pull Request in our repository. This allows us to maintain a clear history of contributions and ensures that all definitions are version-controlled.
Then, it will go through the same process as any other Pull Request, including validation and community review.

Here's a visual representation of our workflow:

## Our Community

Our platform brings together four key groups: **Public Health Practitioners** who contribute their expertise through syndrome definitions,
the **Technical Community** that builds tools and models using this data, **Healthcare Organizations** that implement these definitions in
practice, and the **Academic Community** that uses this knowledge for research and education.

## The Power of Open Format

By choosing an open format and Git-based workflow, we're making medical knowledge more accessible and standardized. This approach enables everything from machine learning research to clinical education. Practitioners can share their knowledge easily, researchers can develop new syndrome discovery models, and organizations can implement standardized definitions in their systems.

## Getting Started

Whether you want to contribute new syndrome definitions or use existing ones, starting is simple.
Contributors submit their definitions through [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request),
and users can access the definitions through our website in various formats - `JSON`, text, or through direct GitHub access.

This initiative represents a step toward more open, standardized, and collaborative medical knowledge sharing.
By bringing together clinical expertise and modern technology infrastructure, we're creating a valuable resource
for the entire healthcare community.
