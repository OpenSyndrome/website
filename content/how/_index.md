The Open Syndrome Initiative is a collaborative platform that standardizes how we define case and syndrome definitions
in machine-readable.
Using open source as our foundation, we've created a simple yet powerful system where healthcare practitioners can
contribute their knowledge while making it accessible to researchers, organizations, and developers worldwide.
