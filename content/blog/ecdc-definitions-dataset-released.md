# ECDC Case Definitions Now Available in Open Syndrome Format

We are excited to announce a significant milestone in public health surveillance: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) case definitions are now available in the Open Syndrome format.
This development marks a crucial step forward in standardizing disease surveillance across Europe and beyond.

## What This Means for Public Health

The Open Syndrome format provides a structured, machine-readable approach to representing case definitions, making it easier for public health organizations to:

* Implement automated surveillance systems
* Share data across different platforms and jurisdictions
* Maintain consistency in case reporting
* Update definitions quickly as new evidence emerges

## Technical Details

The case definitions have been converted into JSON format following the Open Syndrome specification (version 1.0). Each definition includes:

* Standardized clinical criteria
* Clear logical operators for combining symptoms and signs
* Version control for tracking updates
* Multilingual support
* Machine-readable thresholds and measurements

## Getting Started

Healthcare organizations and developers can access these definitions through our public repository. The definitions are available in multiple formats, including JSON and CSV, making them accessible for various implementation needs.

## What's Next

This release is just the beginning. We are working on:

* Additional case definitions from other major health organizations
* Tools for converting existing definitions to Open Syndrome format
* APIs for real-time access to updated definitions
* Validation tools for checking implementation compliance

## Join the Community

We invite public health professionals, developers, and researchers to contribute to this initiative. Visit our GitHub repository to learn more about implementation, suggest improvements, or report issues.

Together, we're building a more standardized and efficient global disease surveillance system.
